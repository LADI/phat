	* phat/phatkeyboard.c: added null to varargs functions to fix missing
	sentinel warnings.

2005-07-11  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* phat.spec.in (Requires): added catches for phatkeyboard files.

	* phat/phatsliderbutton.c (value_to_string): removed manual digit
	limiting code.  I have no clue why I was doing that originally, I
	hope it wasn't for any good reason.

2005-07-06  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* phat/phatkeyboard.h (enum): moved key dimensions enums here so
	that they are globally accessible.

2005-07-03  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* phat/phatkeyboard.c (draw_key): cleaned up drawing routine.
	Sorta.  Lots of futt bucking bullshit going on in here, but the
	end result works.

2004-10-10  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* phat.pc.in: added Requires: section

	* phat/phatkeyboard.*: added keyboard widget.

2004-10-09  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* phat/phatsliderbutton.c: make sure digits are never greater than
	MAXDIGITS.
	(update_size): adjusted alignment of sliderbutton prefix and
	postfix.

2004-10-08  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* phat/phatsliderbutton.c (phat_slider_button_new): allow lower
	and upper ends of range to be equal.

	Fixed problem of drag increments not equal to requested
	increments.  Switched to a digits option, instead of a format
	specifier.

	* phat/phatsliderbutton.h: Switched to a digits option, instead of
	a format specifier.

2004-10-02  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* configure.ac: PHAT_VERSION=0.2.3

	* phat/phatsliderbutton.c (phat_slider_button_expose): replaced
	"buttondefault" with NULL as hint to gtk_paint_box() call to clear
	the box; this was causing crashes with the smooth engine because
	we weren't deriving from a GtkButton and didn't have its border
	properties.  That hint doesn't cause crashes when used with
	gtk_paint_shadow() functions, so we can still get a good looking
	button.  Should contact smooth engine maintainers and figure out
	if this is a bug or a feature.

2004-09-29  Pete Bessman  <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>

	* phatsliderbutton.c, phatfanslider.c: changed tests in _set_range
	from (lower < upper) to (lower <= upper).

2004-08-15 Pete Bessman <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>
	
	* phatfanslider.c: added invert option and mousewheel support to
	fansliders, now draws differently when insensitive.  Added support
	for focus and keyboard events.

	* all widgets, the cursor is now unhidden after scrolling on
	button press

	* demos have been reorganized and improved to show off new features
	
	* phatsliderbutton.c: added support for focus and keyboard
	events. Hilites now painted with "button" hint instead of
	"buttondefault" hint.

	* I'm sure I did other stuff and fixed other bugs that I can't remember
	
	* release v0.2.0
	
2004-08-14 Pete Bessman <ninjadroid@gazuga.net>p

	* changed API naming conventions for the fansliders to mimic GTK+
	customs
